# to-do-list
This is a simple "To-Do List" web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

- HTML structures the page with an input box and a button to add tasks, which are displayed in an unordered list.
- The CSS handles the styling, including layout, colors, and task appearance.
- JavaScript manages the functionality: tasks can be added, checked off, or removed, with the data saved in `localStorage` to persist across page reloads.
